# UCS8904-communication-protocol-
Hi, can anyone provide a brief overview on UCS8904 communication protocol please? I want to interface a MCU ESP8266 with an LED strip containing several UCS8904 but I am not sure how many bits I should send a time in order to encode the Colors RGBW. I know that, for WS2815B, I had to send 24 bits to encode the colors RGB. Thanks for the help!
